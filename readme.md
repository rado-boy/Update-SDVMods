This is a powershell script made to download & update Stardew valley mods using Nexus Mods API (https://www.nexusmods.com/news/13921) to act as a (very) rudimentary mod manager.  I mostly created this to get a little more experience with web APIs and Powershell in general, so it's currently not meant for serious usage.  This is just a fun project!


Requirements:

- Nexus Mods Personal API Key (requires Premium)
- Powershell (Latest preferred, should work with 5+)

Dependencies:

- 7Zip4Powershell: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/7Zip4Powershell/
